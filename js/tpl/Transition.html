            <h2>Transition Year</h2>
            <p>This 4th Year is optional in Causeway Comprehensive. Transition Year students experience a broad range of activities aimed at developing their self esteem, creativity and initiative as well as their communication and personal development skills. They continue to study the core curriculum throughout the year.</p>

            <h2>Drama</h2>
            <p>Drama is an integral part of transition year. It is a very popular subject and all students take part with great enthusiasm. Every year transition year students at Causeway Comprehensive work with drama expert Margaret O’Sullivan, who has a master’s degree in drama and most recently played the widow in the new Irish life commercial which is currently being broadcast on RTE.   </p>
            <p>Over the last few years, performances have included plays by John B. Keane and William Shakespeare. </p>
            <p>Transition year students benefit hugely from the drama experience. The staging of the play helps to build confidence and strengthen communication skills. Studying the play and learning the lines gives an insight to the English language and can be of great benefit to the students who will be studying Shakespeare for their Leaving Certificate.</p>
            <p>Last year’s T.Y. students took on the formidable challenge of one of Shakespeare’s greatest plays – A Midsummer Night’s Dream. The 22 member cast put on many performances and qualified for the All-Ireland Transition Year Drama Competition Final. They were, in fact, the only Kerry school to reach this stage of the competition.</p>
            <p>Already preparation has begun for this year’s performance of Shakespeare’s – A Comedy of Errors. We will face the challenge with energy and enthusiasm that will hopefully lead to another fantastic performance from the Transition year students of Causeway Comprehensive School.</p>
