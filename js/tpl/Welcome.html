            <h2>Helping you make good decisions and stay on course</h2>
            
            <p>Our School welcomes each student into a friendly, caring and supportive community, where we recognise that each young person is unique and has different talents and different needs. In partnership with parents we promote a christian ethos and nurture a positive self-image in students. This enhances their self-confidence and allows them to realise their full potential.</p>
            <p>We provide a well balanced, educational programme so that all our students can develop skills and attitudes that will allow them to grow up into mature, responsible well-rounded individuals capable of living fulfilling lives and making a worthwhile contribution to society.</p>
